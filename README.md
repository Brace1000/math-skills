# Math-Skills
* This program reads from a file containing values and print the result of each statistic mentioned below.

* Average
* Median
* Variance
* Standard-Deviation
* In other words, your program must be able to read the data present in the file passed as argument.(data.txt)

## Features
- statistical calculations are performed using appropriate functions.
* The data represents statistical population.
* The values are rounded integers
* only integers are allowed
- Error handling is implemented to handle invalid data or file reading errors.
* my program takes any file with numeric values as long as its considered in the scope
* considers integers above intfloat64

* After reading the file, your program must execute each of the calculations asked and print the results in the following manner

Average: 6
Median: 9
Variance: 2
Standard Deviation: 1

 ## Dependencies
 * The progrm is written in Go language
 - The program relies on the Go standard library and potentially any additional libraries or packages imported within the Go program


## Usage

1. To run this program run this command.
```bash
go run . data.txt
```
2.To test the program run this command
```bash
go test -v
```
